These instructions are for the jarfileonly zip file.   This is an easier patch
install for core code changes that are specific to the application itself (the
core blueseer.jar file).

There are three files in the jarfileonly zip file, including this
instructions.txt file.   

1)  extract the blueseer.jar file from the zip and overwrite the
BlueSeer/dist/blueseer.jar file with the extracted file.

2)  extract the .patch file from the zip and overwrite the BlueSeer/.patch
file with the extracted file.

3)  Restart the application

You're done.
