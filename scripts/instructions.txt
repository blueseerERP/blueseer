These instructions are for the jaronly zip file.   This is an easier patch
install for core code changes that are specific to the application itself (the
core blueseer.jar file).


1)  extract all files of type .jar from the zip and copy into the
blueseer/dist directory...overwriting what may already be there. 

2)  Restart the application

You're done.
